# FHIR-On-Pi
Series of articles about the installation of the HAPI Fhirserver on a Raspberry Pi. Summary in English, most of it in Dutch.

In this Git repository you'll find seven (7) articles in PDF-format describing -in Dutch- my experiences in installing the HAPI FHirserver on a Raspberry Pi. It is a step-by-step report of successes and failures, but finally resulting in a working HL7 FHIR environment on a creditcard-size computer.
The articles were published on LinkedIn in december 2020 and january 2021. Because of the interest shown by non Dutch-speaking readers I also wrote an English summary. This summary, also in PDF-format can be found in this repo too.
Enjoy!
